## üì¶ Features

- Encrypts all files in a specified directory (`~/infection`) with AES-128-CBC
- Appends `.ft` to encrypted files and deletes the original
- Decrypts previously encrypted files using a saved encryption key
- CLI interface with custom options for reverse (decrypt), version, and help

---

## üß™ How It Works

- When encrypting, the tool:
  - Generates a random 16-byte key (displayed in the terminal ‚Äî **save it!**)
  - Encrypts each file in the `~/infection` directory
  - Stores the IV and encrypted data in a `.ft` file
  - Deletes the original

- When decrypting, the tool:
  - Takes a 32-character hex key (same one from encryption)
  - Looks for `.ft` files in `~/infection`
  - Extracts the IV and decrypts the data
  - Restores the original file and deletes the `.ft`
